## Introduction: Why "No-SSH"?

In modern cloud environments, especially when adopting DevOps best practices and immutable infrastructure models, it is increasingly recommended to avoid direct login access (SSH/RDP) to servers whenever possible. This approach, known as the **"No-SSH" style**, promotes:

- Stronger security by eliminating backdoor access.
- Clear separation between operational management and system state.
- Greater automation and resilience.

Inspired by the following ideas, this module helps implement "No-SSH" or minimal-access cloud infrastructures, especially when you still need to configure credentials during provisioning.

## Why This Module Was Created

Traditional Terraform workflows either:

- Statically store credentials in state files (risky!), or
- Rely heavily on persistent SSH key management (contradicting No-SSH philosophy).

This module was created to solve:

- **Secure, ephemeral credential generation** at VM creation time.
- **No persistent secrets** unless explicitly required.
- **Support for rotation awareness** without breaking Terraform's refresh model.
- **Integration with Azure Key Vault** when retrieval is needed securely.

No Azure Key Vault nor HashiCorp Vault is required for basic usage, but they can be integrated for secure storage and retrieval of credentials.

## Supported Usage Scenarios

| Scenario                                    | How to Use                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1. Windows VM, No Retrieval                 | Set `var.password`, leave `var.key_vault_password_secret = null`. Password is assigned and then thrown away. No one, including the creator, can later access it.               |
| 2. Linux VM, No Retrieval (Public Key)      | Set `var.private_key` to generate a temporary key pair. Use the public key to configure the VM. Private key is discarded. No one, including the creator, can later access it.  |
| 3. Password Stored in Azure Key Vault       | Set `var.password` and configure `var.key_vault_password_secret`. Password is assigned to VM and securely stored as a Key Vault Secret for later retrieval.                    |
| 4. Private Key Storage                      | Set `var.key_vault_key`. Private key is securely stored as a Key Vault Key for later retrieval.                                                                                |

## Credential Rotation Support

This module optionally supports a **rotation notification** system via `var.time_rotating`:

- Even without `var.time_rotating`, ephemeral credentials are **regenerated** each time Terraform refreshes them.
- Configuring `var.time_rotating` adds a monotonically increasing **version number** (`value_wo_version`) and a **next rotation timestamp** (`rotation_rfc3339`).
- This is helpful for downstream systems like Azure Key Vault or custom automation to know when to rotate or expire secrets.

> **Note:** `var.time_rotating` **cannot be used** when the `var.key_vault_key` is set — rotation of the Key Vault Key must be set by `var.key_vault_key.rotation_policy.automatic` instead.
> **Note:** `var.time_rotating` **does not control** when the ephemeral password/private key is regenerated — it only creates a rotation metadata mechanism.
> **Note:** No way to retrieve the private key. The private key generated by `tls_private_key` is ephemeral and not stored anywhere. The private key stored in Azure Key Vault is designed to be non-retrievable, ensuring it is only used for ephemeral operations.

## Key Outputs

| Output             | Description                                                    |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `password_result`  | The generated password (sensitive).                     |
| `value_wo_version` | Updated when a rotation event happens (increase-only version). |

## Security Best Practices

- If you must retrieve credentials (e.g., via Key Vault), ensure tight access control.
- Remember that **ephemeral credentials refresh** every Terraform run, aligning with zero-trust principles.

> **Warning:** If `var.key_vault_password_secret` is not set, all generated credentials (passwords and private keys) will be discarded after VM creation and will not be retrievable later.
